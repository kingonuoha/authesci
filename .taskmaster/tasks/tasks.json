Also, create `components/layouts/` for `DashboardLayout`. Implement `components/modules/index.ts` to re-export all components from their respective subdirectories, following the example: `export * from './auth/AuthCard';` This ensures components can be imported like `import { ComponentName } from '@/components/modules';`.",

Additionally, create `lib/constants/styles.ts` to define common Tailwind CSS class strings, such as `CARD_STYLES` as shown in the PRD, to mitigate inconsistent styling.
